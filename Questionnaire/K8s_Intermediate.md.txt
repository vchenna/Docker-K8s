Kubernetes – Intermediate Questions:

1. Differences between NodePort, ClusterIP, and LoadBalancer

ClusterIP - Default service type that exposes the service internally within the cluster via a virtual IP.
NodePort - Exposes the service externally by opening a port (30000–32767) on every node; traffic is forwarded to the service.
LoadBalancer - Provisions a cloud provider load balancer and forwards external traffic to NodePort/ClusterIP services.


2. What is a StatefulSet and where is it used?
StatefulSet manages stateful applications by providing stable network identities, persistent storage, and ordered deployment, scaling, and deletion.

Used for:

Distributed databases (Cassandra, MongoDB)
Stateful apps requiring persistent volumes
Applications needing predictable Pod naming


3. What is a DaemonSet? Give use cases.
A DaemonSet ensures that one instance of a Pod runs on all or selected nodes.

Use cases:

Node-level log collectors (Fluentd, Filebeat)
Monitoring agents (Prometheus Node Exporter)
Storage/volume plugins
Network plugins (CNI)


4. What is Ingress and why is it used?
Ingress is an API object providing layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) routing to expose services outside the cluster.
It uses an Ingress Controller and supports:

a. Path-based routing
b. Host-based routing
c. TLS termination
d. Load balancing rules


5. What is a ServiceAccount?
A ServiceAccount is an identity used by Pods to authenticate to the Kubernetes API.
It provides:

API access credentials
Role-based access controls (RBAC)
Token mounting for secure communication


6. Explain Taints and Tolerations.

Taints are applied to nodes to repel certain pods.
Tolerations are applied to pods to allow scheduling on nodes with matching taints.

They control where pods are allowed or not allowed to run.

7. What is node affinity and anti-affinity?

Node Affinity: Schedules pods on nodes that match specified labels (preferred/required).
Pod Anti-affinity: Prevents pods from being scheduled on the same node as certain other pods to improve redundancy.

Used for:

Workload placement optimization
High availability
Hardware-specific scheduling


8. What is the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?
HPA automatically scales the number of Pod replicas based on metrics such as:

CPU utilization
Memory usage
Custom metrics

It continuously monitors metrics and adjusts replica counts to maintain performance.

9. How does Kubernetes perform rolling updates?
Rolling updates in a Deployment replace Pods incrementally by:

Creating new Pods with the updated version
Gradually terminating old Pods
Ensuring the app remains available (controlled by maxUnavailable and maxSurge settings)

Supports rollback to previous versions.

10. What is a CronJob?
CronJob creates Jobs on a defined schedule using cron expressions.
Used for:

Periodic tasks
Backups
Report generation
Cleanup operations


11. How does the Kubernetes Scheduler work?
The scheduler assigns Pods to nodes based on:

Resource requests
Node capacity
Taints and tolerations
Affinity/anti-affinity rules
Node readiness
Custom scheduling policies

It scores eligible nodes and selects the optimal node for Pod placement.

12. What happens when a Pod crashes?

The kubelet restarts the container based on its restartPolicy.
If part of a Deployment or ReplicaSet:
The controller creates a new Pod to maintain the desired replica count.
Failed Pods may be rescheduled on another node if the node becomes unhealthy.


13. How do requests and limits work in Kubernetes?

Requests: Minimum CPU/memory guaranteed to a Pod; used by scheduler for placement.
Limits: Maximum allowed CPU/memory; exceeding memory limit results in OOMKill.

Enforces resource fairness and avoids node overloading.

14. What is a sidecar container?
A sidecar is a secondary container running inside the same Pod as the main container.
It supports the primary container by providing:

Logging
Proxying (Envoy/Istio)
Data synchronization
Configuration reloaders


15. What is minikube and when is it useful?
minikube is a lightweight tool to run Kubernetes locally using VirtualBox, Docker, or other drivers.
Useful for:

Learning and experimentation
Development and testing
Trying Kubernetes features before deploying to production

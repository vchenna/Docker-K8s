Kubernetes – Basic Questions:

1. What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
In other words, Kubernetes is like a manager for containers. It keeps our applications running, fixes things if they break, and adds more capacity if needed.

2. What is a Pod in Kubernetes?
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more tightly coupled containers that share storage and network resources.
In brief, it is like a small box that holds one or more containers. Kubernetes uses Pods to run your app.

3. What is a Deployment?
A Deployment is a Kubernetes object used to manage stateless applications. It ensures the desired number of Pods are running and supports rolling updates and rollbacks.
It is like a blueprint that tells Kubernetes how many Pods to run and what version of the app to use.

4. What is a Service in Kubernetes?
A Service provides stable networking for Pods. It exposes Pods internally or externally using a consistent IP and DNS name, even if Pods change.
It is like a phone number for your app. Even if Pods change, the phone number stays the same so others can reach it.

5. What are the types of Kubernetes Services?

ClusterIP – internal access within the cluster (default)
NodePort – exposes service on a port of each node
LoadBalancer – exposes service externally through cloud load balancer
ExternalName – maps service to an external DNS name
Headless Service – no cluster IP; used for direct Pod access (e.g., StatefulSets)

In brief:
ClusterIP – reachable only inside the cluster
NodePort – reachable from outside the cluster using a node’s IP and port
LoadBalancer – reachable from the internet through a cloud load balancer
ExternalName – redirects to an external website or service
Headless – no stable IP; lets clients talk directly to individual Pods


6. What is a Node?
A Node is a worker machine (VM or physical server) where Kubernetes runs Pods. It contains components like kubelet, kube-proxy, and container runtime.
It is a machine (server or VM) where your Pods actually run.

7. What is a Namespace?
A Namespace is a way to divide cluster resources logically. It helps isolate applications, teams, and environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).
It is like a folder used to organize resources inside a cluster.

8. What is a ConfigMap?
A ConfigMap stores non-sensitive configuration data (key–value pairs) that Pods can use at runtime.
It stores normal settings (not secret) that our app uses.

9. What is a Secret?
A Secret stores sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, and certificates in an encoded format.


10. What is a ReplicaSet?
A ReplicaSet ensures a specified number of identical Pod replicas are running at any time.
That is, a ReplicaSet makes sure a certain number of Pods are always running. If one Pod dies, it creates a new one.

11. What is a kubelet?
The kubelet is an agent running on each node. It ensures containers in Pods are running as instructed by the Kubernetes control plane.
In brief, a kubelet is a helper program on every node. It watches the Pods and makes sure they are running.

12. What is kubectl?
kubectl is the command-line tool used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster (deploy apps, check logs, inspect resources, etc.) and manage everything.

13. What is the difference between a Pod and a Container?

Container: Runs the application.
Pod: Wrapper around one or more containers, adding networking, storage, and metadata.

14. What is ETCD?
etcd is a distributed key-value store used by Kubernetes to store all cluster data, including configurations, state, and metadata.

15. What is the purpose of kube-proxy?
kube-proxy manages network rules on each node and routes traffic to the correct Pod based on service definitions.
In other words, kube-proxy is the traffic controller. It helps send network requests to the correct Pod.
